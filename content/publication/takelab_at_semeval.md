abstract = "This paper describes our system for the detection of stances in tweets submitted to SemEval 2016 Task 6A. The system uses an ensemble of learning algorithms, fine-tuned using a genetic algorithm. We experiment with various offthe-shelf classifiers and build our model using standard lexical and a number of task-specific features. Our system ranked 3rd among the 19 systems submitted to this task."
